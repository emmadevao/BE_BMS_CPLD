#  CPLD Programming 


This project is realized within the context of the multidisciplinary project   
The aim of this project is to code a CPLD in order to control 5 switches. These switches are composing a Battery Management System (BMS). 


--- 

## Actual progress:

- [x] Determine switches sequence for each configuration
- [x] State machine diagram
- [x] VHDL Code
- [x] Simulation 
- [x] Implementation on the test card

## Repository organisation 

`CPLD.pdf`: Description of the global architecture  
`BMS.vhd`: VHDL code of the state machine   
`testcpt.vhd`: Simulation code  
`BMS.ucf`: Pinlock for the implementation     
> Pins correspond to the test card CPLD(XC9572XL-10VQG44C) but we use a different one for our project CPLD(XC9572XL)  
>> Same manufacturer: Xilinx    

`sch_CPLD.pdf`: Test card schematic  
`vhdverg.pdf`: Fine documentation about the comparison between VHDL/Verilog  
`/BMS`: all files generated by Xilinx ISE  
`/Screenshots`: Several screenshots of results (simulations and logic analyzer)
